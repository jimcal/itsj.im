According to Washington state school attendance rules, a child must be five years old by August 31 to attend kindergarten. Seattle Public Schools offers the opportunity for parents of students who demonstrate observable, significantly advanced levels of social and cognitive readiness to apply for an exception to this rule. Students whose fifth birthday occurs between September 1 and October 31 may apply to be evaluated for a one-month trial in kindergarten.

Applications are available in April
Birth date verification required (copy of birth certificate or passport)
There is a testing fee of $130 (may be waived for low-income families)
Testing and readiness evaluations occur in May
Results are posted in June
Approved students may register in June to attend kindergarten in September 2019
As parents consider the decision to apply for Early Entrance to Kindergarten, please consult with others who work with your child in a comparable educational setting and can provide information to you regarding advanced readiness in all of the following domains:

Social-Emotional
Physical
Language
Cognitive
Literacy
Mathematics
Testing and readiness evaluations are conducted by Seattle Schools Kindergarten teachers, are conducted in person, and a report is provided to families with results.
